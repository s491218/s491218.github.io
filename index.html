	<h1>Computer Science Game Project</h1>
	<h2>Our project is a remake of Frogger</h2>
	<h4> A short description of the game</h4>
	<p> The object of the game is to get your player to the other side of the screen without getting hit. Cars on the road are a threat to take you out at any point.Once you have cleared the cars, you must use the constantly moving logs to make your way to the other side of the forest. But if you misstep then you will fall into the water.</p>

	<h3> Reflections </h3>
	<p> For the controls we took our code from previous labs. Making the Canvas was reletivly easy, the hard part was the collision detection.The main issue with the collision detection was our coordinates, but Once we got that down our game was done. </p>
